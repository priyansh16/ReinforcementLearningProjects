# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains four different reinforcement learning (RL) projects, each focusing on different problems which are solved using RL algorithms such as Q-learning. These projects involve defining state representations, designing reward functions, and fine-tuning RL parameters for optimal performance.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Rocket Stabilization using Q-Learning

In this project, a **Q-learning controller** was implemented to keep a rocket facing **upward consistently**. The key components include:

- **State Space Representation**: Defined based on sensor data.
- **Reward Function**: Designed to encourage stable hovering.
- **Learning Algorithm**: Trained to improve stabilization over time.

### 2. Q-Learning for different Worlds

This project applies **Q-learning** to different environments where each world presents unique challenges. The focus was on:

- **Fine-tuning learning parameters** for better adaptability.
- **Handling different world-specific issues** to improve convergence.

### 3. RL Parameter Tuning in Frozen Lake Environment

This experiment involved fine-tuning RL parameters for the classic **Frozen Lake** environment. The key aspects covered:

- **Optimizing exploration-exploitation tradeoff** to enhance learning.
- **Adjusting hyperparameters** such as discount factor and learning rate to improve success rate.

### 4. Simple Hockey Agents using Reinforcement Learning

In this project, **two RL agents** were trained to learn how to play simple hockey. The agents were designed to:

- **Understand the environment** through carefully crafted state representations.
- **Use custom reward functions** to encourage goal-scoring and defensive strategies.
- **Balance offensive and defensive play** to maximize performance.
- **Learn through self-play**, improving their strategies over time by competing against each other.
